# Chapter 7: Correlation and Regression

## Correlation Test 


We can now return to the case of two quantitative variables and the question of whether or not they are related. Specifically, we have a test of 

$H_0: \rho =0$ (no relationship) vs $H_a: \rho \ne 0$ (some relationship) 

The assumptions of the test are that the relationship is linear and that there are no outliers. We can use the **mplot** command to check them. The command to find the p value is  **pearson.cor.**

#### **Case Study:** The 1970's Military Draft

We have previously used simulation to see that a sample correlation r=-0.226 is very unusual (for n=366). Now we can do the formal test:

1) Parameter: Pearson's correlation coefficient $\rho$
2) Method: Test for Pearson's correlation coefficient $\rho$
3) Assumptions: relationship is linear and that there are no outliers.
4) $\alpha = 0.05$  
5) $H_0: \rho =0$ (no relationship between Day of Year and Draft Number) 
6) $H_a: \rho \ne 0$ (some relationship between Day of Year and Draft Number) 
7) p = 0.0000 
```{r, echo=2, fig.show='hide'}
attach(draft)
pearson.cor(Draft.Number, Day.of.Year, rho.null = 0)
```

8) $p=0.0000 <\alpha = 0.05$, so we reject the null hypothesis,
9) There is a statistically significant relationship between Day of Year and Draft Number.  

Assumptions: boxplots and scatterplot show no outliers. No non-linear relationship.   
  
#### **Case Study:** Alcohol vs. Tobacco Expenditure
Data from a British government survey of household spending may be used to examine the relationship between household spending on tobacco products and alcoholic beverages. The numbers are the average expenditure for each of the 11 regions of England. 

The marginal plot shows one outlier:

```{r, warning=FALSE}
attach(alcohol)
mplot(Tobacco, Alcohol)
```

This is Northern Ireland, observation # 11. Eliminating this observations show no more outliers, and a linear relationship:

```{r}
mplot(Tobacco[-11], Alcohol[-11])
```

So the test is:

1) Parameter: Pearson's correlation coefficient $\rho$
2) Method: Test for Pearson's correlation coefficient $\rho$
3) Assumptions: relationship is linear and that there are no outliers.
4) $\alpha = 0.05$ 
5) $H_0: \rho =0$ (no relationship between Alcohol and Tobacco) 
6) $H_a: \rho \ne0$ (some relationship between Alcohol and Tobacco) 
7) $p = 0.0072$

```{r fig.show='hide'}
pearson.cor(Tobacco[-11], Alcohol[-11], rho.null = 0)
```

8) $p=0.0072 < \alpha = 0.05$, so we reject the null hypothesis,
9) There is a statistically significant relationship between
Alcohol and Tobacco

**Note:** Running the test with Northern Ireland would have given the wrong answer:

```{r fig.show='hide'}
pearson.cor(Tobacco, Alcohol, rho.null = 0)
```


p value of test for now is:  0.5087 > 0.05

**Example** below is the data from the following experiment: on 30 consecutive days we recorded the number of sales in store. During this time an add campaign was run. Find a $90\%$ confidence interval for the correlation of Day and Sales.

```{r echo=FALSE}
sales <- data.frame(Day=1:30,
                 Sales=round(50+1:30/5+rnorm(30,0,3)))
kableExtra::kable(sales)
```

```{r}
attach(sales)
mplot(Day, Sales)
pearson.cor(Day, Sales, conf.level = 90)
```
