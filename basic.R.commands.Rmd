## Basic R commands

Once you have started a session the first thing you see is some text, and then the > sign. This is the  **R prompt**, it means R is waiting for you to do something. 

Let's start with   
```{r, eval=FALSE}
ls() 
```
shows you a "listing"" of the files (data, routines etc.)

Everything in R is either a data set or a function. It is a function if it is supposed to do something (maybe calculate something, show you something like a graph or something else etc. ). If it is a function is `r hl()$fontcolor("ALWAYS NEEDS ()")`. Sometimes there is something (called an argument) in between the parenthesis, like in the hplot() example above. Sometimes there isn't like in the ls(). But the () has to be there anyway.

If you have worked for a while you might have things you need to save, do that by clicking on 

File > Save Workspace

If you quit the program without saving your stuff everything you did will be lost. R has a somewhat unusual file system, everything belonging to the same project (data, routines, graphs etc.) are stored in just one file, with the extension .RData. 

To close R click on the x in the upper right corner. 

R has a nice recall feature, using the up and down arrow keys. Also, typing 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
history() 
```

shows you the most recent things entered.

R is case-sensitive, so a and A are two different things.

Often during a session you create objects that you need only for a short time. When you no longer need them use  **rm** to get rid of them:
  
```{r}
x <- 10
x^2
rm(x) 
```

the **<-** is the *assignment* character in R, it assigns what is on the right to the symbol on the left. (Think of an arrow to the left)

### Data Entry with the keyboard

For a few numbers the easiest thing is to just type them in:
```{r}
x <- 2
x
x <-  c(10, 2, 6, 9)
x
```

c() is a function that takes the objects inside the () and  **c**ombines them into one single object (a vector). 

### Getting Data from Moodle Quizzes

Most moodle quizzes will require you to transfer data from the quiz to R. This is done with the command *get.moodle.data()*. There are two steps:

-  in moodle use the mouse to highlight the data. If it is a table with several columns ALWAYS include the column headers (names of variables). 

-  switch to R and run

```{r eval=FALSE}
get.moodle.data()
```

Now the data should be in R. It is called x. You can always check by typing x and hit ENTER. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
x
```

Here are some examples:

a) single set of numbers:

say this is what you see in the quiz:
![](C:/Users/Wolfgang/Dropbox/teaching/Esma-3015/graphs/moodle.data.example.1.png)

Now use the mouse to high-light (JUST!) the numbers, go to R and type

```{r eval=FALSE}
get.moodle.data()
```

You should see this:

Data begins with:
[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6

Data has been saved as x

and you can check that the correct data has been transferred with:

```{r echo=FALSE}
x <- 1:108
```

```{r}
x
```


this also works if the data is not numbers:

![](C:/Users/Wolfgang/Dropbox/teaching/Esma-3015/graphs/moodle.data.example.2.png)


```{r echo=FALSE}
x <-
c("Medium", "X-Large", "Medium", "Large", "Large", "X-Large", 
"Large", "X-Large", "X-Large", "X-Large", "Large", "X-Large", 
"Large", "X-Large", "X-Large", "Large", "Large", "Large", "Medium", 
"Large", "Medium", "Small", "Large", "Large", "Small", "Small", 
"Small", "Small", "Large", "X-Large", "Large", "Large", "Large", 
"Large", "Medium", "Medium", "Small", "Medium")

```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
get.moodle.data()
```

```{r}
x
```

b) data is in the form of a table with several columns:

![](C:/Users/Wolfgang/Dropbox/teaching/Esma-3015/graphs/moodle.data.example.3.png)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x <-
structure(list(RPM = c(2100L, 2200L, 2300L, 2400L, 2500L, 2600L, 
2700L, 2800L, 2900L, 3000L, 3100L, 3200L, 3300L, 3400L, 3500L, 
3600L, 3700L, 3800L, 3900L), Oil = c(0.9, 2.4, 0.5, 0.8, 1.6, 
-0.2, 1, 0.8, 1.5, 0.3, 0.5, 1.7, -1.3, -1.4, 2.1, 0.4, -2.1, 
1.7, 1.3)), class = "data.frame", row.names = c(NA, -19L))
attach(x)
```

**Note** you need to high-light the column names as well! (here RPM Oil) but NOT the dashed line.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
get.moodle.data()
```

```{r}
x
```

if the data is a table it is immediately attached and you can use the column names, for example

```{r}
mean(RPM)
```

*Note* on rare occasions the routine can fail if the data is a table but everything is text. In that case use the argument is.table=TRUE.

*Note* sometimes you might get a warning from R, as long as the data is transferred correctly you can ignore that. 

## Data Types in R

the most basic type of data in R is a **vector**, simply a list of values. 

Say we want the numbers 1.5, 3.6, 5.1 and 4.0 in an R vector called x, then we can type 

```{r}
x <- c(1.5, 3.6, 5.1, 4.0)
x
```

Often the numbers have a structure one can make use of:

``` {r}
1:10 
10:1
1:20*2
c(1:10, 1:10*2)
```

Sometimes you need parentheses:

```{r}
n <- 10
1:n-1
1:(n-1)
```

### Commands for Vectors

To find out how many elements a vector has use the *length* command: 

```{r}
x <- c(1.4, 5.1, 2.0, 6.8, 3.5, 2.1, 5.6, 3.3, 6.9, 1.1)
length(x)
```

The elements of a vector are accessed with the bracket [ ] notation:

```{r}
x[3]
x[1:3]
x[c(1, 3, 8)]
x[-3]
x[-c(1, 2, 5)]
```

this also works with logic operations:

```{r}
x[x>4]
x[x<=5.1]
```


Instead of numbers a vector can also consist of characters (letters, numbers, symbols etc.) These are identified by quotes:

````{r} 
c("A", "B", 7, "%")
```

A vector is either numeric or character, but never both (see how the 7 was changed to "7").

### Data Frames

data frames are the basic format for data in R. They are essentially vectors put together as columns. 

The main thing you need to know about working with data frames are the following commands:

#### **Case Study:** UPR Admissions

consider the  **upr** data set . This is the application data for all the students who applied and were accepted to UPR-Mayaguez between 2003 and 2013. 

```{r}
dim(upr)
```

tells us that there were 23666 applications and that for each student there are 16 pieces of information.

```{r}
colnames(upr)
```

shows us the variables 

``` {r}
head(upr, 3)
```

shows us the first three cases.

Let's say we want to find the number of males and females. We can use the table command for that:

```{r,echo=FALSE}
rm(Gender)
```


``` {r, eval=FALSE}
table(Gender)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat("Error: object 'Gender' not found\n")
```


What happened? Right now R does not know what Gender is because it is "hidden" inside the upr data set. Think of **upr** as a box that is currently closed, so R can't look inside and see the column names. We need to open the box first:

```{r}
attach(upr)
table(Gender)
```

**Note**: you need to attach a data frame only once in each session working with R. 

**Note**: Say you are working first with a data set "students 2016" which has a column called Gender, and you attached it. Later (but in the same R session) you start working with a data set "students 2017" which also has a column called Gender, and you are attaching this one as well. If you use Gender now it will be from "students 2017".

**Note** when the data was transferred from moodle with get.moodle.data() it is automatically attached.

### Subsetting of Data Frames

Consider the following data frame (not a real data set):

```{r, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(111)
Age <- sample(18:25, size=10, replace=T)
GPA <- round(runif(10, 2, 4), 1)
Gender <- sample(c("Male", "Female"), size=10, replace=T)
students <- data.frame(Age, GPA, Gender)
```

```{r}
students
```

Here each single piece of data is identified by its row number and its column number. So for example in row 2, column 2 we have "3.2", in row 6, column 3 we have "Male". 

As with the vectors before we can use the  [ ] notation to access pieces of a data frame, but now we need to give it both the row and the column number, separated by a ,:

```{r}
students[6, 3]
```

As before we can pick more than one piece:

```{r}
students[1:5, 3]
students[1:5, 1:2]
students[-c(1:5), 3]
students[1, ]
students[, 2]
students[, -3]
```

### Vector Arithmetic 

R allows us to apply any mathematical functions to a whole vector:

```{r}
x <- 1:10
2*x
```

```{r}
x^2
```

```{r}
log(x)
```

```{r}
sum(x)
```

```{r}
y <- 21:30
```

```{r}
x+y
```

```{r}
x^2+y^2   
```

```{r}
mean(x+y) 
```

### Subsetting

One of the most common tasks in Statistic is to select a part of a data set for further analysis. There is even a name for this:  **data wrangling**. 

#### **Case Study:** New York Air Quality Measurements 

Description: Daily measurements of air quality in New York, May to September 1973.

A data frame with 154 observations on 6 variables.

Ozone: Mean ozone in parts per billion from 1300 to 1500 hours at Roosevelt Island

Solar.R: Solar radiation in Langleys in the frequency band 4000-7700 Angstroms from 0800 to 1200 hours at Central Park

Wind: Average wind speed in miles per hour at 0700 and 1000 hours at LaGuardia Airport

Temp: Maximum daily temperature in degrees Fahrenheit at La Guardia Airport.

Source: The data were obtained from the New York State Department of Conservation (ozone data) and the National Weather Service (meteorological data).

```{r}
head(airquality)
```

This task of data wrangling is so important, there are quite a lot of routines that are helping with it. One of them is  **isubset**. 

Here is what you do:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
airAugSept <- isubset(airquality) 
```

The app lets you use up to three conditions, we just have one (Month $\ge$ 8), so we can leave that alone. Now choose the condition and then hit "Click when ready to run" 

Here is a screenshot:

![](C:/Users/Wolfgang/Dropbox/teaching/Resma3/Rmd/isubsetfig1.png)


now hit Close App and return to R.


In this example we used a very simple condition: Month $\ge$ 8. These conditions can be much more complicated using & (AND), | (OR) and !(NOT). 

Let's say what we want only those days in August and September with a Temperature less than 80:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
airAugSeptTemp80 <- isubset(airquality)
```

![](C:/Users/Wolfgang/Dropbox/teaching/Resma3/Rmd/isubsetfig2.png)

Finally let's say we want only either those days in August and September with a Temperature less than 80, or days with Wind>10:

![](C:/Users/Wolfgang/Dropbox/teaching/Resma3/Rmd/isubsetfig3.png)

`r hl()$vspace()`

Let's get back to the days in August and September. What we want to do with those days is to find the mean Ozone level:

```{r echo=FALSE}
airAugSept <- subset(airquality, Month>=8)
```

```{r error=TRUE}
attach(airAugSept)
stat.table(Ozone)
```

OK! 

#### **Case Study:** Age and Gender in Puerto Rico in 2000

Breakdown of the population of USA and Puerto Rico by age and gender, according to the 2000 Census.

```{r}
head(agesex)
tail(agesex)
```

shows us  that the data set consists of three vectors: the ages, the number of males and the number of females. The first one is a character vector ("less than 1") and the other two are numeric.  

`r hl()$vspace()`

Let's answer a few questions about the age and gender in PR in 2000: 

-  What was the number of men and women in PR in 2000? 
 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
rm(Age)
```
 
 
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
attach(agesex)
sum(Male)
```

```{r}
sum(Female)
```
`r hl()$vspace()`

-  How many people where there in PR?

Simple:

```{r}
sum(Male)+sum(Female)
```

we will need the column with the Male and Female counts a few more times, so maybe we should do it this way:

```{r}
People <- Male + Female
head(People)
sum(People)  
```

**Note**

we now have another variable called People among the data sets, as we can see with

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ls()
```

It will stay there until we close R. If we want to keep it for the next time we use R we need to save everything with File > Save Workspace. If we want to save the workspace but not this variable we first have to 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rm(People) 
```
`r hl()$vspace()`

-  How many newborns were there?

``` {r}
People[1]
```
`r hl()$vspace()`

-  How many teenagers were there?

teenagers (Age from 13 to 19) are in rows 14 - 20, so 

```{r}
sum(People[14:20])
```
`r hl()$vspace()`

-  What percentage of the population was male, rounded to 1 digit behind the decimal point? 

```{r}
sum(Male)/sum(People)*100
round(sum(Male)/sum(People)*100, 1)
```
`r hl()$vspace()`

-  In how many age groups were there more males than females?

```{r}
sum(Male > Female)
```
`r hl()$vspace()`

-  What age group had the largest population? 

``` {r}
max(People)
agesex[People==64795, ]
```

**Note** == is the symbol for "is equal to". The others are 

-  $<$   "is less than"
-  $<=$   "is less or equal to"  
-  $>$  "is greater than"
-  $>=$  "is greater or equal to"

So the age group of 10 year olds is the largest. Why is this answer a bit strange?

-  what percentage of the population was 100 year or older?

```{r}
agesex
```

so that rows 101-103, so

```{r}
sum(People[101:103])/sum(People)*100
```


`r hl()$vspace()`

#### **Case Study:** World Mortality Rates

Mortality rates and life expectancy of countries in 2017:

```{r}
head(world.mortality.2017, 3)
```

-  What are the numbers for Puerto Rico?

```{r}
attach(world.mortality.2017)
world.mortality.2017[Country=="Puerto Rico", ]
```

-  What countries had the shortest and the longest life expectancy for men?

```{r}
range(LifeExpectancy.Males)
world.mortality.2017[LifeExpectancy.Males==49.6, ]
world.mortality.2017[LifeExpectancy.Males==81.1, ]
```

-  in how many countries is the life expectancy of men higher than of women?

```{r}
sum(LifeExpectancy.Males>LifeExpectancy.Females)
```

-  What 5 countries have the lowest infant mortality rates?

```{r}
sort(InfantMortality)
Country[InfantMortality==2]
```

#### **Case Study:** Age and Sex in US, by State


We saw before that in PR 0.0225 percent of the population is 100 years old or older. How does that compare to the other states?

The data set agesexUS has the the numbers for all states. The total population in 2000 was

```{r}
attach(agesexUS)
colnames(agesexUS)
```

so we see there is a column called Total in column 2, which give us the population for each state. The columns with the people 100 and older are columns number 104, 105 106 (males) and 208, 209 and 210 (female), so

```{r}
old <- agesexUS[, 104] + agesexUS[, 105] +
       agesexUS[, 106] + agesexUS[, 208] +
       agesexUS[, 209] + agesexUS[, 210]
percentage <- old/Total*100
names(percentage) <- State
sum(percentage<0.0225)
```

so 40 of the 50 states have a lower percentage.
