The class web pages are at [http://academic.uprm.edu/wrolke/esma3015](http://academic.uprm.edu/wrolke/esma3015)


###  General Info

You can get a free version of R for your computer from a number of sources. The download is about 70MB and setup is fully automatic. Here are some links: 

[Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base)

[MacOS](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx)

After the installation is finished close R (if it is open). From now on `r hl()$fontcolor("ALWAYS")` open R by clicking on the link to to the RESMA3 file on top of the home page. You can also download and save that file to your own computer and start R from there. 

The first time you do this the program will download a number of additional stuff, just let it do that. It can take a while, be patient. Also a window might pop up and ask whether to save something, if so click on yes. 

If you see a message: Welcome to Resma3! everything is good!

**Note** 

-  You might be asked at several times whether you want to do something (allow access, run a program, save a library, ...), always just say yes!

-  You will need to connect to a reasonably fast internet for these steps.

`r hl()$hr()`

**FOR MAC OS USERS ONLY**

There are a few things that are different from MacOS and Windows. Here is one thing you should do:

Download XQuartz - XQuartz-2.7.11.dmg  
Open XQuartz      
Type the letter R (to make XQuartz run R)        
Hit enter
          Open R 
          Run the command .First()          
Then, every command should work correctly. 

###  Troubleshooting

if you try to run a command and get an error

could not find function "ggplot" 

or a similar error message

first try this: run the command
```{r, eval=FALSE}
ls() 
```

You should see a listing of many things (over 200). If you do not Resma3 did not load correctly (did you see the welcome message?). Close R and restart it by clicking on the link to Resma3 on the home page.

If you do see the listing, type
```{r, eval=FALSE}
one.time.setup() 
```

A number of things should be happening, just wait until you see the > again and see whether that fixes the problem. 

If this does not work turn off R and restart it with a new version of Resma3 from the top of the class home page. 

If this also does not work send me an email with the explanation of the problem. The best thing to do is to include a  screenshot. Here is how:

[Windows](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-take-a-screenshot-in-any-version-of-windows/)

[MacOS](http://www.imore.com/screenshot-mac)

You can also just use your cell phone to take a picture of the screen, but make sure it is is readable! 

`r hl()$hr()`

I often get an email saying that something is not working, and my answer is simply:  

**RGDM**

this means: **R**ead the **G**od-**D**amn **M**anual! 

that is the answer to your problem is somewhere on these pages, and you should have found it there before sending an email! 

`r hl()$hr()`

Throughout this class when you see something like this:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
text 
```
it means commands you should type (or copy-paste) what is in the box ("text") into the R console. If you type it be careful to get it exactly right!    

`r hl()$vs()`

To see whether everything is installed correctly copy-paste the following line into R and hit enter:  

```{r}
hplot(rnorm(1000))
```
 
You should see a graph like this (called a histogram)
